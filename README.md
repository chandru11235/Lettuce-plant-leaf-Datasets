#Lettuce plant leaf datasets

Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is an annual plant of the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is most often grown as a leaf vegetable, but sometimes
for its stem and seeds. Lettuce is most often used for salads, although it is also seen in other kinds of food, such as soups, sandwiches
and wraps; it can also be grilled. One variety, the woju, or asparagus lettuce (celtuce), is grown for its stems, which are eaten either 
raw or cooked. In addition to its main use as a leafy green, it has also gathered religious and medicinal significance over centuries of 
human consumption. Europe and North America originally dominated the market for lettuce, but by the late 20th century the consumption of 
lettuce had spread throughout the world. World production of lettuce and chicory for calendar year 2015 was 26.1 million tonnes, 56% of 
which came from China.


I have gone through all the webistes for datasets including plant village, crowdai, and so many others but cant find the particular
datasets on lettuce diseased and healthy images.. and so created my own datasets using google search engine. 


In this datasets only few images are provided, if you are interseted in adding other diseased leaf images of lettuce plants
it will be more helpful for me and to others who may need this..
